The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee information efficiently. It simulates real-world HR operations where users (employees) can register, log in securely, view their profile, and update their details. The system integrates modern backend and frontend technologies to provide a smooth and secure user experience.
